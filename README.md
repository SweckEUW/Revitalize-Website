We created this website for a Web Development and Corporate Design course. We designed a complete corporate identity including a logo, a target group and a corporate philosophy. Based on the corporate identity, we design the web pages starting with wireframes and went to create interactive prototypes in Adobe XD. After the Design process was done, we programmed the website using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
