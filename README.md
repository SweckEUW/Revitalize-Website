I created this together with 3 colleagues website for a Web Developement and Web & Corporate Design course. We had to create a complete corporate identity including a logo, a target group, philosophy and more. We also had to design the web pages including wireframes, site interactions, information architecture. After the Design process we had to programm the website with client side storage and server side form validation.
