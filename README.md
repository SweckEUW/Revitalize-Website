I created this website together with 2 fellow students for a Web Developement and Web & Corporate Design course. We had to create a complete corporate identity including a logo, a target group, corporate philosophy and more. We also had to design the web pages including wireframes, site interactions and information architecture. After the Design process we had to programm the website using client side storage and server side form validation.
